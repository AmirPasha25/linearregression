# LINEAR REGRESSION

## ABOUT :

---

-   **Linear Regression** is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used to model the **linear relationship** between an **independent variable (X)** and a **dependent variable (y)**.
-   The model is represented by the equation.
    -   Formula : y = mx+b
    -   **m (slope)**: Represents how much **y changes for a one-unit change in x**.
    -   **b (intercept)**: Represents the **value of y when x = 0**. It is the point where the regression line **intersects the y-axis** and acts as the **baseline value** of the dependent variable when there is no influence from the independent variable.

## LINEAR REGRESSION ASSUMPTIONS :

---

**The assumptions of linear regression must hold either completely or approximately for the model to perform well and produce reliable results.**

1.  **Linearity:** 
    
2.  **Homoscedasticity:**
    
3.  **No Multicollinearity:**
    
4.  **Normality of Errors:**
    
5.  **Independence of Observations:**


## MATHEMATCIAL FORM:
	•	Simple linear regression:
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
	•	Multiple linear regression:
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_n x_n
